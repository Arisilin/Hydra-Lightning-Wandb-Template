# Tiny-bVAE
A simple yet well disentangled implementation of VAE/Î²VAE. Sample of using Hydra+wandb+Pytorch Lightning.

# NOTE
Still in development(for utilities like visualization and evaluation), so code might be break.
But feel free to use this as an develop template for your own project. It's great pleasure if you find this helpful.
